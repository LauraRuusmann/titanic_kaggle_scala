# titanic_kaggle_scala
Participation in Kaggle competition using Scala and Spark ML

## About

This is a Scala project created with the intention of learning to use Apache Spark with Scala by participating in a Kaggle competition about Titanic survivors.

I have tinkered some code by Raphael Brugier with some good ideas I found from a tutorial online. Mainly improved feature engineering and indexing some categorical features. The original example had an area under the ROC curve score of 0.79426. My best result: 0.80382.  
Even though this program provides cross-validated predictions, I obtained my best result in the competition without cross-validation.
